# Logistic-Regression_Modelling-Car-Insurance-Claims

This project leverages the statsmodel package to build a logistic regression model and predict whether drivers will make a claim on their car insurance. 

We use a fictive database (car_insurance.csv) that contains 16 explanatory variables and one response variable (column "outcome" with two possible values: 0 for drivers that haven't made an insurance claim and 1 for drivers that have made an insurance claim).

We identify the single feature that results in the best performing model, as measured by accuracy.
